## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
-I started with the html layout.
-Then I added an external css stylesheet.
-Finally, I re-touched to replicate the design as best possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to learn how to use flexbox to complete this challenge. It wasn't easy as I had to leave it at some point and then get back to it. I'm quite happy with my progress so far.
I learnt that referencing folder is very vital in how the code runs. And the fact that the code shows well in the local server doesn't necessarily mean it would show when deployed and hosted live. I had this issue and I was able to resolve it by restructuring how I referenced the folders. It wasn't easy but I figured it out.
I also learnt that using the universal selector (*) in assigning property values to elements in CSS can affect the design. Thanks to Emmanuel and Charles who helped point out my error.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I loved to get better at using flex box and grid in CSS. I'm also open to new frameworks that would help me become a better developer.

Special thanks to Emmanuel Yusuf and Charles Obuzor, my circle mates from AltSchool Africa for giving me quick fixes to the design when I had challenges with background color.
